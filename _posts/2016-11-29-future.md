- Project Maintenance
- Current Status: Where We are Now
- Future: Where We Want to Go!

## Project Maintenance

Maintaining any large open source project could deserve it's own article, but Babel itself covers a lot of ground: core packages, plugins, build integrations such as gulp, webpack, etc (many of which we ourselves may not use), and more. We want to be able to support community plugins, presets, and ideas.

Babel has it's place in many tutorials, guides, talks, etc for various frameworks. The project itself has definetely helped me to understand the language better through bug fixes and support questions. We are active on twitter, slack, and github across other projects that use Babel. We have to balance new features, bug fixes, browser support, speed of compilation/generated code, plugin options, ease of use, working with individuals, big companies, libraries, and more.

I believe our main goal is to make it possible to write Javascript in any environment you support as seamless as possible and through that support the future of Javascript tooling.

## Current Status

### Maintaining Babel plugins [for each proposal in TC-39](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) starting from stage-0

Users should be able to easily use features before they are actually released in browsers in stage 4.

This is the core of Babel. It had it's start as a javascript transpiler for ES6 back when it was still called 6to5.

In short, proposal champions won't be getting much feedback if no one is actually trying them out in actual code. Babel is a fundamentally important step to the TC-39 process given familiarity in the ecosystem, a simple config change in most people's build process rather than through browser flags, and relative ease of implementation vs. native implementation.

This isn't just a one-time thing as we've found out, especially for early stage proposals. The creation of a plugin means the eventual maintenance of that same plugin. Proposals could completely change in syntax or even get dropped. Since TC-39 meets every 2 months, the plugins should be updated as meetings happen so that users can be in sync and involved with the standards process.

> Some transforms are simply out of date (one example is decorators) and Logan had to make [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for the previous version and no one has had time for an update.

> A good example: [babel/babel#3473](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/3473) wasn't merged for so long because just didn't have time to review it. By the time it was merged it had already moved from stage-2 to stage-3.

### Maintaining other ecosystem plugins: like JSX/Flow.

There is both a React/Flow team at Facebook and they have many issues/PRs associated with Babel that we have to review/maintain.

- [React plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#react)
- [Flow plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-flow-strip-types)

### Autoprefixer for Babel via [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env)

This is something that is very important as we move forward to a point where users are compiling a specific set of transforms while the browsers support a specific set of features. There is a constant sliding window. This preset picks the right amount of plugins supported by the target environments so that the code can be fast/smaller.

The next big feature would be dynamic checking of polyfills as well as syntax as described in [babel/babel-preset-env#20](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/20).

### Linting via [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint)

As long as you want to lint javascript with experimental features (stage-x, types) that ESLint proper won't support yet.

Future: Better interop with ESLint (hook into scope, traversal), possibility of writing an ESLint rule with babel APIs, running ESLint rules as plugins/presets?

### Minification

[babel/babili](https://github.com/babel/babili) was created as a future proof minifier.

It will be continually updated to take advantage of the latest javascript features (ES2015+ aware). Each transform can be independent and also pluggable.

### Codemods/Refactoring

[jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [js-codemod](https://github.com/cpojer/js-codemod), [Lebab](https://github.com/lebab/lebab).

By passing in recast in the options, Babel can also be run on source code and can power the future of codemods. This feature was just made possible so looking forward to making it easier to do and the transformations it can enable.

### Code Coverage / Instrumentation

With tools like [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and [babel-plugin-instanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul).

### API Documentation / Community

Meetups, tutorials, videos, open source workshops, etc.
Docs should be explaining each feature and possible usages, improved links to books, articles, etc.

- All plugins should have examples/repl links. Can also embed runkit.
- Update Learn ES2015 to have ES2015+.
- Add resources page
- Update FAQ with common errors
- Page for community plugins
- babel-handbook, API docs, etc

## Future

### [Plugin API Changes](https://github.com/babel/notes/blob/master/2016-08/august-01.md#potential-api-changes-for-traversal)

Currently many users have trouble with plugin/preset ordering and it's very confusing what plugin is run before/after and how to make it do so. This is a fundamental change to the core of Babel which will take some work to figure out.

### Use Type Information

Integrate with a type system such as flow/typescript to make optimizations.

> Sidenote: Be able to understand typescript syntax (similar to flow), add a plugin to strip typescript types for better interop.

### Read the dependency graph

Integrate with other tools like webpack/bundlers? This will allow cross file transformations or whole codebase optimizations.

### Parser Errors

Better error messages from the parser like in [Compiler Errors for Humans](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">babel-eslint@7.1.1: now adds the code frame when there&#39;s a parser error! <a href="https://t.co/yoxRpGXq5E">pic.twitter.com/yoxRpGXq5E</a></p>&mdash; Henry Zhu (@left_pad) <a href="https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/799388723896946692">November 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> It's obvious that we all want to see helpful errors!

- [babel/babylon#125](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/125): Instead of "Unexpected token" explain that `await` needs to be used in an async function.
- Do better inference/guessing on user intention to prevent vague errors.

### `babel-init`

Basically a way to setup babel easier like create-react-app does.

- Setup a .babelrc from scratch
- Maybe reuse `babel` npm package to default to use babel-preset-env

### Run [tc39/test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262)

Running official spec tests against Babel to make sure we comply to the spec or at least know when we don't.

### Smoke Tests

[motiz88/babel-smoke-tests](https://github.com/motiz88/babel-smoke-tests).

### Program Analysis

- [Program Slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing) with [slice-js](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/faster-javascript#/)
- Semantic (AST aware) Grepping tool

### `babel --debug`

Print out all info when erroring. Also perf tooling to get more info on how long each plugin takes.

### Syntax plugins:

Opening the gates might lead to an ecosystem of incompatible plugins.

#### Pluggable Parser

There's been a lot of talk about this but not much progress. Acorn/Babylon does already support overriding parser methods (like with JSX/Flow) but were not sure we want to do this just yet. Workaround is to fork it and pass that to Babel.

#### Sweet.js Interop

Previous [issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/568#issuecomment-71716260). Maybe we can just figure out how to have better interop instead.

Anything not already brought up here? Please send us a tweet @babeljs, a message on our slack (join at slack.babeljs.io), or create an RFC-like issue in our repo!

## How will it happen? Another Call for Contributors!

Old Issues:

- [Call for Contributors!](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1347)
- [Being prepared for getting hit by a bus](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1888)

You might think that as [a project get more widely used](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=babel-core) that more people show up to help out but like most oss projects that aren't backed by a company there is a constant issue with maintaince and sustainability; people get burned out, move on to other cool projects, or get busy with work, life, family, etc.

### Documentation/Website

Definetely has been lacking in contributors the [last year](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/graphs/contributors?from=2015-11-29&to=2016-11-29&type=c).

However, just recently we've done some awesome stuff:

- [@Daniel15](https://github.com/Daniel15) has been maintaining [babel-standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone) which we use in the REPL and has some automation when new releases get out.
- [@maxiloc](https://github.com/maxiloc) added search functionality via Algolia via [#977](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/977)

and added some new collaborators like: 

- [@STRML](https://github.com/STRML): Added discourse to all github pages via [#875](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/875)
- [@xtuc](https://github.com/xtuc): Added support for reading the README from the babel repo so we don't have to sync 2 copies of docs via [#990](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/990)
- [@fredericmarx](https://github.com/fredericmarx): Added support for a copy to clipboard button for code snippets via [#998](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/998)
- [@seedofjoy](https://github.com/seedofjoy): Added a resize ability for the REPL via [#1003](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/1003)
