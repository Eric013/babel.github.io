- Project Maintenance
- Current Status: Where We are Now
- Future: Where We Want to Go!

## Project Maintenance

Maintaining any large open source project could deserve its own article, but Babel itself covers a lot of ground: core packages, plugins, build integrations such as gulp, webpack, etc (many of which we ourselves may not use), and more. We want to be able to support community plugins, presets, and ideas.

Babel has its place in many tutorials, guides, talks, etc for various frameworks. The project itself has definitely helped me to understand the language better through bug fixes and support questions. We are active on twitter, slack, and github across other projects that use Babel. We have to balance new features, bug fixes, browser support, speed of compilation/generated code, plugin options, ease of use, working with individuals, big companies, libraries, and more.

We want to continue to allow developers to write the latest version of Javascript in any environment. With that supporting all the tools around that: linting, minification, codemods, code coverage, etc.

## Current Status

### Maintaining Babel plugins [for each proposal in TC39](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) starting from stage 0

Babel uses [TC39's concept of stages](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#stage-x-experimental-presets-) to categorize its experimental plugins.

Users should be able to easily use features before they are actually implemented in browsers in [stage 4](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

This is the core of Babel. It had its start as a javascript transpiler for ES6 back when it was still called 6to5.

In short, proposal champions won't be getting much feedback if no one is actually trying them out in actual code. Babel is a fundamentally important step to the TC39 process given familiarity in the ecosystem, a simple config change in most people's build process rather than through browser flags, and relative ease of implementation vs. native implementation.

This isn't just a one-time thing as we've found out, especially for early stage proposals. The creation of a plugin means the eventual maintenance of that same plugin. Proposals could completely change in syntax or even get dropped. Since TC39 meets every 2 months, the plugins should be updated as meetings happen so that users can be in sync and involved with the standards process.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My rule of thumb on how I decide what future features to transpile:<br>&quot;Could I reasonably codemod this if it changes?&quot;<br>Don&#39;t do it otherwise.</p>&mdash; Kent C.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> Maybe we should rename or alias the stage x presets to explain more that they are "experimental".

> Some transforms are simply out of date (one example is decorators) and Logan had to make [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for the previous version and no one has had time for an update.

> A good example: [babel/babel#3473](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/3473) wasn't merged for so long because we just didn't have time to review it. By the time it was merged it had already moved from stage 2 to stage 3.

### Maintaining other ecosystem plugins: JSX/Flow.

There is both a React/Flow team at Facebook and they have many related issues/PRs that we have to review.

- [React plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#react)
- [Flow plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-flow-strip-types)

### Autoprefixer for Babel via [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env)

This is something that is very important as we move forward to a point where users are compiling a specific set of transforms while the browsers support a specific set of features. There is a constant sliding window. This preset picks the right amount of plugins supported by the target environments so that the code can be fast/smaller.

The goal of this effort is to make it simple to ship native code while allowing users to use the latest spec features. This will result in smaller payloads to users.

The next big feature would be dynamic checking of polyfills as well as syntax as described in [babel/babel-preset-env#20](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/20).

### Linting via [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint)

As long as you want to lint javascript with experimental features (stage x, types) that ESLint proper won't support yet.

Future: Better interop with ESLint (hook into scope, traversal), possibility of writing an ESLint rule with babel APIs, running ESLint rules as plugins/presets?

### Minification

[babel/babili](https://github.com/babel/babili) was created as a future-proof minifier.

It will be continually updated to take advantage of the latest javascript features (ES2015+ aware). Each transform can be independent and also pluggable.

### Codemods/Refactoring

Other relevant projects: [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast), [Lebab](https://github.com/lebab/lebab).

By passing in [Recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) in the options, Babel can also be run on source code and can power the future of codemods. This feature was just made possible so we're looking forward to making it easier use and seeing the transformations it can enable.

Check out the [6.16.0 blog post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2016/09/28/6.16.0#new-feature) for more info!

### Code Coverage / Instrumentation

With tools like [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and [babel-plugin-instanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul).

## Future

### [Plugin API Changes](https://github.com/babel/notes/blob/master/2016-08/august-01.md#potential-api-changes-for-traversal)

There is a lot of confusion around how plugins/presets interact regarding ordering. This results in bugs and issues with the config which require users to place plugins before/after others in a non-intuitive way.

This is a fundamental change to the core of Babel which will take some work to figure out.

### Typescript Support

Be able to understand Typescript syntax (like we do with flow) and add a plugin to strip Typescript types for better interop. This would just mean parsing Typescript specific syntax and stripping it out. Anything more would require a lot more work and discussion.

### Use Type Information

Integrate with a type system such as Flow/Typescript to make optimizations. This just means that Babel should be able to gain the knowledge through those tools that an identifier `arr` is actually an `Array` or not.

> There are a few plugins that actually do type checking: https://github.com/codemix/babel-plugin-typecheck and https://github.com/gcanti/babel-plugin-tcomb

### Take in a Dependency Graph

Integrate with other tools like Webpack/bundlers? This will allow cross file transformations or whole codebase optimizations. The main reason for this would be for the minifier (being able to remove properties based on checking the usage across the whole application) or providing errors for missing/invalid import/exports.

### Parser Errors

Better error messages from the parser like in [Compiler Errors for Humans](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">babel-eslint@7.1.1: now adds the code frame when there&#39;s a parser error! <a href="https://t.co/yoxRpGXq5E">pic.twitter.com/yoxRpGXq5E</a></p>&mdash; Henry Zhu (@left_pad) <a href="https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/799388723896946692">November 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> It is obvious that we all want to see helpful errors!

- [babel/babylon#125](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/125): Instead of "Unexpected token" explain that `await` needs to be used in an async function.
- Do better inference/guessing on user intention to prevent vague errors.

### `babel-init`

Basically a way to setup babel easier like create-react-app does.

- Setup a `.babelrc` from scratch
- Maybe reuse the `babel` npm package to default to use babel-preset-env

### Run [tc39/test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262)

Running official spec tests against Babel to make sure we comply to the spec or at least know when we don't.

### Smoke Tests

It would be useful to either have a reverse [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) or to run tests with master branch of Babel so that we can catch any major regressions before any release. In theory we would want to take the biggest open source projects that use babel and run their tests.

[motiz88/babel-smoke-tests](https://github.com/motiz88/babel-smoke-tests) is a start!

### API Documentation / Community

Meetups, tutorials, videos, open source workshops, etc.
Docs should explain each feature and possible usages, improved links to books, articles, etc.

- All plugins should have examples. Can also embed [RunKit](https://runkit.com/home) or the REPL.
- Update Learn ES2015 to have ES2015+.
- Add resources page
- Update FAQ with common errors
- Page for community plugins
- babel-handbook, API docs, etc

### Program Analysis

- [Program Slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing) with [slice-js](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/faster-javascript#/)
- Semantic (AST aware) Grepping tool

### `babel --debug`

This command would print out all info (also when erroring). It would also include performance metrics on how long each plugin takes.

### Syntax plugins:

#### Pluggable Parser

There's been a lot of talk about this but not much progress. Acorn/Babylon does already support overriding parser methods (like with JSX/Flow) but were not sure we want to do this just yet. Workaround is to fork the parser and pass that instead of Babylon to Babel.

#### Sweet.js Interop

Previous [issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/568#issuecomment-71716260). Maybe we can just figure out how to have better interop instead.

Anything not already brought up here? Please send us a tweet @babeljs, a message on our slack (join at [http://slack.babeljs.io/](slack.babeljs.io), or create an RFC-like issue in our repo!

## How will it happen? Another Call for Contributors!

Old Issues:

- [Call for Contributors!](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1347)
- [Being Prepared for Getting Hit by a Bus](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/1888)

You might think that as [a project get more widely used](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=babel-core) that more people show up to help out, but like most OSS projects that aren't backed by a company, there is a constant issue with maintenance and sustainability; people get burned out, move on to other cool projects, or get busy with work, life, family, etc.
